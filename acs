Hi Sharon,

Thanks for your response. I request to provide me an assistance on the below matter please

I was trying to file my EOI application a week ago and noticed that I am lacking of 3 months experience to gain full work experience points (15). As you suggested on the ACS report, I added my experience after May 2008 to until 31-Jan-2018 which includes my Australian experience (18 Months).I obtained the 5 points for the Australian experience  and only 10 points for the remaining work experience (<8 years). Because my work experience came down to 7 years and 10 months after deducting the 18 months of work experience in Australia. 

In order to gain the full points (15 points) to the work experience, Could I request you to evaluate my ACS application again and see if you can provide me additional work experience preferably since Jan 2008 instead of after May 2008 if possible?

If not,  I am planning to add my current working experience (01-02-2018 to Now) to gain full work experience points. Please let me know the process to amend my current working experience to the existing ACS Report?

Thank you
